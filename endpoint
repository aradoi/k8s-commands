# Endpoints are lists of pod IPs and ports that match the service's label selector. The service object is always watching the API server to see if new pods that match its selector are being added or removed. As they are, it automatically updates the list in the endpoint object.
# The endpoint object itself always has the same name as the service object and is implicitely created. It's a list of pods a service can send requests to. A client makes a request to the frontent config of the service and for the service to know how to forward requests instead of doing an on-the-fly lookup to see which pods on the cluster actually currently match the label selector, it picks one from the endpoint list, because it's always up to date (list is updated by the service itself, when changes are being observed)
# Flow: incoming request -> service -> endpoint -> service -> pods
